##Â TESTS, security analysis, and code quality

# Scan the source code. 
# - we don't need detection of text/template as it's not a web application, and
# - we don't need sha1 detection as it is not used for cryptographic purposes.
# Note: metrics are actually not sent to anyone - it's a thing that is removed from the code in the future.
